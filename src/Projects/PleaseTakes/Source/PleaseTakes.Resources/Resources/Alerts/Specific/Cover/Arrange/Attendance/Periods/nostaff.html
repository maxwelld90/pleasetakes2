<h4>No Staff Attendance Records Found</h4>
The database did not return me any results for your query. This can be because of two reasons:
<ul class="SimpleList">
	<li>You haven't actually selected anyone as absent over in <a href="#Attendance" onclick="switchToTab('Attendance');">Staff Attendance</a>, or</li>
	<li>You entered a query above that yielded no results. Click the refresh button above to remove the search query.</li>
</ul>
If you don't mark at least one person absent for one period during the day, you will not be able to proceed to the final step.
