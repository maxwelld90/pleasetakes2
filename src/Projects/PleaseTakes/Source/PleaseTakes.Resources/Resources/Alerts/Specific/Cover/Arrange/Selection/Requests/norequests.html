<h4>No Cover Requests Found</h4>
The database didn't return me any cover requests matching the specified criteria. This can be because of two reasons, namely:
<ul class="SimpleList">
	<li>You haven't actually marked anyone as absent in the Period Selection tab, or</li>
	<li>You entered a query above that didn't return any results. Click the reset button above to remove the search query.</li>
</ul>
You won't be able to proceed any further until you mark at least one member of staff absent for at least one teaching period of the day.
